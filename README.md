# Fairness-in-Machine-Learning

My team implemented 5 post processing techniques on 3 different ML models and trained them on the Broward County data to provide a fair alternative to COMPAS which is used by U.S. court systems to evaluate recidivism in defendants. 
Performed secondary optimization using the metrics: accuracy and financial cost.
Wrote a concise report to put forward the model/fairness combination and justify all algorithmic/ethical considerations.
